# Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication System Using LiFi and ESP8266

## Overview
This project implements a **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication system** using **LiFi** technology for data exchange between vehicles. The system is designed to improve road safety by enabling real-time communication of critical information, such as traffic updates or collision warnings, between multiple vehicles. Communication between vehicles is facilitated using **infrared (IR)** with **TSOP1738** sensors and ESP8266 modules for master-slave, one-to-many communication.

## Features
- **LiFi-Based Communication**: Uses LiFi (Light Fidelity) with infrared (IR) signals to enable data transmission between vehicles.
- **Master-Slave Setup**: Utilizes ESP8266 modules to implement one-to-many communication architecture.
- **Real-Time Data Sharing**: Sends and receives important traffic updates, collision alerts, and vehicle proximity warnings.
- **Infrared Sensors**: IR communication is facilitated through TSOP1738 sensors for reliable, high-speed data transfer.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**:
  - ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
  - Infrared (IR) transmitter and receiver (TSOP1738)
  - LEDs for transmitting LiFi signals
- **Software**:
  - MicroPython/C for ESP8266 programming
  - Communication protocols for V2V data exchange
- **Communication**:
  - LiFi (IR-based communication)
  - ESP8266 for Wi-Fi-based data transmission

## System Architecture
1. **Data Transmission**: Vehicles equipped with ESP8266 modules transmit data using LiFi (IR) through LEDs.
2. **IR Sensors**: TSOP1738 IR sensors receive the signals, converting them back into data that the ESP8266 module can process.
3. **Master-Slave Communication**: One vehicle (master) sends data to multiple vehicles (slaves) using ESP8266 modules to establish the communication channel.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Critical data such as speed, traffic conditions, and emergency alerts are shared among vehicles in real time.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi modules
- Infrared LEDs and TSOP1738 sensors
- Power supply (for ESP8266 and sensors)
- MicroPython/C development environment

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/V2V-LiFi-Communication.git
    ```
2. Connect the ESP8266 modules with the IR transmitter and TSOP1738 receiver circuits.
3. Flash the ESP8266 with the provided MicroPython code in the `firmware` folder.
4. Modify the LiFi transmission parameters based on your use case (e.g., distance, data rate).
5. Run the code to establish a V2V communication link between multiple vehicles.

## Usage
1. Power on the ESP8266 modules on both master and slave vehicles.
2. The master vehicle transmits data using LiFi, which is received by the slave vehicles.
3. View real-time data transmission such as collision alerts and traffic updates.
4. The system will notify vehicles when they are in close proximity to prevent accidents.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more sensors such as GPS for location-based warnings and alerts.
- Improve the range and reliability of LiFi-based communication.
- Add encryption for secure V2V communication.
- Expand the system to support V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication with infrastructure.
